MicroMUD was a project that I started whilst in University in 2003, I've slowly added to it over the years but stopped most work on it at the end of 2012. I'm using it now to dust off my C++ knowledge having worked predominately in .NET for the last three years. I will be re-creating MicroMUD from scratch in the MicroMUD repo.
