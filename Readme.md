# MicroMUD

MicroMUD was a project that I started at the end of University in 2007, I've slowly added to it over the years but stopped most work on it at the end of 2012. I'm using it now to dust off my C++ knowledge having worked predominately in .NET for the last three years. I will be re-creating MicroMUD from scratch in the MicroMUD repo.

MicroMUD was born out of working in a number of other people's game engines over the years written in both C and C++. Whilst I was working on the Advanced MUD Codebase (based on MUDCore) I really felt the urge to try to write the whole myself from scratch. It was an excellent fun challenge from which I learnt a lot about coding!
